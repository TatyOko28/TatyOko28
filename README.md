  <b>Who I am :grey_question:</b>
</h3>
<p align="justify">
As a passionate self-taught Full Stack Developer, I merge creativity and technical expertise to design digital solutions that are both technically robust and sustainably designed. Committed to continuous learning, I strive to contribute to open source projects, allowing those who need to use my projects to discover, wherever possible, the technologies I employ. Indeed, my initial training in natural resources engineering equipped me with a unique perspective on the importance of sustainability in technological development. <br/>

During college, I dedicated every evening to learning how to code. Over time, this passion for programming became a tangible reality. In February 2020, I started as a junior at @madoumadev. However, the desire to learn and develop new skills never faded. As a result, I've expanded my technical repertoire to include cutting-edge technologies like Python, Django, React JS, Redux, TypeScript and more. This quest for knowledge was not limited to mastering new languages and frameworks; this has extended to understanding and leveraging tools that improve development workflows, such as Postman, AWS, Docker, and Git, among others.<br/>

My hands-on experience with databases, web programming and API integration, complemented by my mastery of creating responsive layouts, ensures that I bring a well-rounded set of skills to any project. My active contributions to open source projects reflect my commitment to knowledge sharing and community building, values that are increasingly vital in today's collaborative digital landscape.<br/>

As a middle full stack developer, my individual and collaborative project work has resulted in robust, user-centric applications that are a testament to my abilities. With my contract ending in February 2024, I look forward to finding a new opportunity where my passion for creating and versatile skills will continue to flourish and drive the success of the company.<br/>

I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills and enthusiasm can align with your company's goals. In anticipation of future collaborations, I invite you to browse my GitHub page for a portfolio of my work and a preview of what I can bring to your team.
